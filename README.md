# Raspberry Pi 4 cluster
Ready to laser-cut Pi 4 Cluster Rack

No need for energy consuming and noicy fans. The thermal flow will keep circulating the air. Se the whole setup decription can be found on Medium article...

In the /dxf dir you will find the files for the lasercutter.

The following pieces have to be cut once/one piece each. The material have to be 3mm in thickness (and preferable in acryl/plaxiglass or transparent material for the visuals):
- 1 x back.dxf
- 1 x back_plexi_pi.dxf
- 1 x bottum.dxf
- 1 x front_top.dxf
- 1 x top.dxf

This is the small front plate, for shielding the view to the switch (It would preferably be in a non-transparent material)
- 1 x bottum_front.dxf

This is the plate that devides the cables and backside of the cluster this can be transparent material, but will make all the wiring visible, so in one of the pictures I use wood instead (a compromise with my wife). Still 3mm material.
- 1 x pi_inner_back.dxf

8 pieces of pi beds, still 3 mm material.
- 8 x pi_bed.dxf

2 pieces of sides to hold the beds (3 mm)
- 2 x pi_sides.dxf

2 Sides to hold it all together have to be <b>6MM material!</b>
- 2	x side_wood.dxf
